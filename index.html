<h2><hr><a name="news"></a>Research Interests</h2>   

<p>Tongliang Liu's research interests lie in providing mathematical and theoretical foundations to justify and understand machine learning models and designing machine learning algorithms for problems in the field of 
<ul>
    <li><p>trustworthy machine learning (robustness, causality, efficiency),</p></li>
    <li><p>multi-modality learning (generative models, 3D computer vision),</p></li>
    <li><p>AI for science (electrochemistry),</p></li>
    <li><p>quantum machine learning.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2><hr><a name="news"></a>Short Bio</h2>   

    <p>Tongliang Liu is the Director of Sydney AI Centre (which has 11 academic staff and 100+ PhD students) and an Associate Professor in machine learning at The University of Sydney, Australia; a Visiting Scientist of RIKEN AIP, Tokyo, Japan; an Affiliated Professor with Mohamed bin Zayed University of Artificial Intelligence, United Arab Emirates; a Visiting Professor with University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei, China.
        Before joining The University of Sydney in 2017, he was a Lecturer at University of Technology Sydney.
He is also leading the <a HREF="https://www.tmllab.ai/" target="_blank" > Trustworthy Machine Learning Lab </a> (TML Lab) at The University of Sydney, which hosts, attracts, and connects the best global talents to develop trustworthy machine learning techniques and tools, which are explainable, robust, fair, causally responsible, and privacy-preserving. Our mission is to make machines trustworthy, which is a foundation for our society to develop and deploy artificial intelligence to improve our lives.  </p>

<p>Tongliang Liu has published more than 200 papers at leading ML/AI conferences and journals. According to CS Rankings, he has been ranked as the first in machine learning in Australasia.
<!--    He has been widely recognised by his research. For example, he was ranked among the Best Rising Stars of Science in Australia by Research.com in 2022; he was ranked among the Global Top Young Chinese Scholars in AI by Baidu Scholar in 2022; -->
<!-- he was named in the Early Achievers Leaderboard by The Australian in 2020.  -->
    He received the Outstanding Research Contribution Award from the Computing Research and Education Association of Australasia, CORE Inc., in 2024, Eureka Prize shortlist for Emerging Leader in Science from Australian Museum in 2023, IEEE AI's 10 to Watch Award from the IEEE Computer Society in 2022, Future Fellowship Award from Australian Research Council (ARC) in 2022, Faculty Early Career Research Excellence Award at The University of Sydney in 2021, the Top-40 Early Achievers by The Australian in 2020, and the Discovery Early Career Researcher Award (DECRA) from ARC in 2018.
    He also received multiple faculty awards, e.g., from OPPO and Meituan.
    Tongliang is also very proud of his talented students, who have made/are making/will make significant contributions to advancing science. They have also been recognised by many awards, e.g., Google PhD Fellowship Awards.</p>


    <p>He is a Co-Editor-in-Chief of Neural Networks. He is a Senior Area Chair of NeurIPS and ICLR. He is regularly the meta-reviewer of ICML, NeurIPS, ICLR, UAI, IJCAI, and AAAI. He is an Associate Editor of IEEE TPAMI, TMLR, MLJ, TIP, and ACM Computing Surveys, and on the Editorial Board of Journal of Machine Learning Research.</p>
